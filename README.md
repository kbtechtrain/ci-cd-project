🚀 Excited to share my latest project on creating a real-time CI/CD pipeline using cutting-edge tools: Git, GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, AWS, and web servers like Apache Tomcat, alongside infrastructure management tools such as Ansible and Kubernetes, with code quality assurance provided by SonarQube! 🌐 Whenever new code is pushed to GitHub, it seamlessly triggers automatic Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

💡 Highlights:

Git & GitHub: Centralized version control system for managing codebase.
Jenkins: Powerful automation tool for orchestrating CI/CD pipelines.
Maven: Dependency management and build automation for Java projects.
AWS & Cloud: Utilizing scalable cloud infrastructure for deployment.
Web Servers (Apache Tomcat): Serving Java-based web applications efficiently.
Ansible & Kubernetes: Infrastructure as code tools for managing and scaling deployment environments.
SonarQube: Ensuring code quality and security through automated code analysis.
🛠️ Key Components of the Pipeline:

Codebase Management: Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration.
Continuous Integration: Jenkins ensures automated build and test processes upon code commits, using Maven for Java projects.
Continuous Deployment: Automated deployment to AWS Cloud instances managed by Ansible and Kubernetes.
Web Server Configuration: Utilizing Apache Tomcat to serve the deployed Java-based application.
Code Quality Assurance: SonarQube scans codebase for quality and security issues, ensuring high standards.
📈 Benefits:

Efficiency: Automating the entire process reduces manual intervention and speeds up deployment.
Reliability: Consistent deployment processes enhance reliability and stability.
Scalability: Leveraging Kubernetes ensures scalability to handle varying loads efficiently.
Code Quality Assurance: SonarQube helps maintain high-quality codebase and improves overall software reliability.
